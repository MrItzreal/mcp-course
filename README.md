# MCP-Course

This repository contains my personal notes and code from a crash course on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). I am following the official documentation and a YouTube tutorial to learn how to build applications with this exciting new protocol.

## üìù About the Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol designed to standardize the way applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). Think of it as a "USB-C port for AI applications," allowing a standardized connection between AI models and various data sources or tools. MCP is essential for building agents and complex workflows on top of LLMs.

#### "MCP is a set of rules that define how to feed context into a model".

## üíª About the YouTube Tutorial

The YouTube tutorial provides a comprehensive crash course on MCP, explaining its core concepts and walking through the process of building both an MCP server and an MCP client from scratch using a TypeScript SDK.

The tutorial covers:

- **Understanding MCP**: A clear definition of the protocol and how it enables communication between a server and a client.
- **MCP Server Components**: An explanation of the four main components of an MCP server: Tools, Resources, Prompts, and Samplings.
- **Building an MCP Server**: A step-by-step guide to setting up an MCP server, including installation, configuration, and implementation of tools and resources.
- **Building an MCP Client**: A demonstration of how to create an MCP client, connect it to the server, and interact with its features.
- **Integration with AI Chatbots**: A look at how to integrate the MCP server with AI chatbots like GitHub Copilot.

## üéØ My Goals

My primary goal is to gain a solid understanding of MCP and its practical applications. By the end of this course, I aim to be able to:

- Explain the core concepts of MCP.
- Build a functional MCP server and client.
- Integrate MCP with other tools and AI models.
